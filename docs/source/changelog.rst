`Unreleased`_
-------------

`0.21.0`_ -- (unreleased)
-------------------------

Added
^^^^^
* Error |NoStateBackend| raised when is tried to access a |StateBackend| in a broker without it
* Attribute ``messaged_id`` in Class |State|
* Method ``get_states`` which returns the states storage in a |StateBackend|
* Method ``get_state_backend`` in ``broker.py``
* Module ``api`` with methods to get the state of a message by HTTP request:
   - url ``/messages/states`` returns all states in the backend
   - url ``/messages/states?name=NameState`` returns all states in the backend whose state is equal to NameState, this should be defined in |StateNamesEnum|
   - url ``/messages/state/message_id`` return the state of a given ``message_id``
* Class |TestMessageStateAPI| responsible to test the API of |StateBackend|
* Add |Flask| as an extra dependency
* Add |CurrentMessage| Middleware that exposes the current message via a thread local variable, useful to access the message within the actor
* Add |TestCurrentMessage| responsible to test the new middleware
* Add |CurrentMessage| to the list of ``default_middleware`` middlewares that are enable by default

`0.20.0`_ -- 2020-04-07
-----------------------
BREAKING CHANGE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* reduce: now take a `size` argument and a `merge_kwargs` argument. `size` determine the number of message that are taken
  at each reduce (merge) step and the `merge_kwargs` are the attributes that will be passed to the merge messages.

Added
^^^^^
* |StateNamesEnum| (type :|Enum|) contains the possible states that can have a message:
   - |Started| a |Message| that  has not been processed
   - |Pending| a |Message| that has been enqueued
   - |Skipped| a |Message| that has been skipped
   - |Canceled| a |Message| that has been cancelled
   - |Failure| a |Message| that has been processed and raise an |Exception|
   - |Success| a |Message| that has been processed and does not raise an |Exception|
* Class |State| represents the current state of a message, the state is defined by:
   - |StateNamesEnum.name| the name of the state
   - args The arguments of the message, they are storage if they are less than  MessageState.max_size
   - kwargs The keyword arguments of the message, they are storage if they are less than  MessageState.max_size
* Middleware |MessageState| used to update the state of a message in a Backend, the constructor receives
   - backend (type : |StateBackend|)
   - state_ttl
   - max_size
* Abstract Backend |StateBackend| with methods |set_state| and |get_state| to set and get a |State| from the Backend
* |RedisBackend| and |StubBackend| (type :|StateBackend|)
* |InvalidStateError| raised when is tried to create an Invalid State
* |TestMessageState| tests of the Middleware |MessageState|
* |TestState| tests of the class |State|

`0.19.0`_ -- 2019-01-31
-----------------------
